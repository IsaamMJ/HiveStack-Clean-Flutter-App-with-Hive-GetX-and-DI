# üöó CarHive ‚Äî A Flutter App using Clean Architecture + Hive + GetX

CarHive is a Flutter application that showcases a **local CRUD system** for car data using **Hive** as the local NoSQL database. It follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern and leverages **GetX** for state management, navigation, and dependency injection.

## üì¶ Features

- ‚úÖ Clean Architecture (Domain, Data, Presentation layers)  
- ‚úÖ GetX for state management, routing, and DI  
- ‚úÖ Hive for fast local NoSQL storage  
- ‚úÖ Add, Edit, Delete, and List Cars  
- ‚úÖ Dark Mode Support üåô  
- ‚úÖ API Integration (Mock data screen)  
- ‚úÖ Debug tool to print Hive data
